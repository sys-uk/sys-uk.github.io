# Second Annual UK System Research Challenges Workshop

Following our successful systems Research Challenges Workshop in 2016, we were
pleased to collaborate with Red Hat to run a further event.

Our second Systems Research Challenges workshop, sponsored by industry partners
Red Hat, took place at Lumley Castle in January 2017.

The aim of the 2017 workshop was to bring together industry with academic
researchers to discuss pressing topics that affect the design and implementation
of large-scale systems, especially in the key challenges of scalability,
dependability and security. The workshop included position paper presentations,
moderated discussions, lightning talks and networking opportunities.

We were delighted to have representation from a number of Universities including
Cambridge, Nottingham, St. Andrews and Cardiff University alongside European
collegues from Lyon. Joining our academic colleagues were senior representatives
from IBM and Red Hat.

The scope of presentations were well received by the delegates, and led to a
number of potential areas for further research and opened up new opportunities
for collaborations across institutions. Further details of all of the talks are as follows:
