# Fifth Annual UK System Research Challenges Workshop, March 17--19, 2020

This is the fifth iteration of a workshop bringing together systems researchers
from across the UK and beyond, to discuss pressing topics affecting the design
and implementation of large-scale systems in a friendly and inclusive setting.

Past topics have included everything from system security and architecture, to
consensus and engineering, to data visualisation, data centres and the Internet
of Things. We aim to be broad and inclusive -- if it's a matter that has bearing
on how we design, build, operate and use large-scale computing systems, it's in
scope.

<b>
We have been monitoring PHE, WHO, and Government advice closely and with deep regret we have taken the decision to postpone the UK Systems Workshop until later in the year due to the impact of the Corvid-19 outbreak.

<b>
This was a difficult decision in a rapidly changing and complex situation. Some of the considerations for this outcome have been based on:

- <b>Speakers and participants restricted by organisational travel bans, which may lead to an increased number of last minute talk cancellations

- <b>The situation is unlikely to improve over the coming weeks, and the unpredictable nature risks putting attendees in a difficult position where they must take a personal decision over whether to attend

- <b>Recommendations and precautionary measures are changing everyday which is impacting our ability to coordinate a successful event

<b>
This has made it likely that, even if we went ahead, we would only be able to run a much reduced programme.

<b>
Rather than do this, or impact the community building nature of the workshop by turning the event into an online conference, we feel that it is better to postpone the workshop until we can run a full programme later in the year.

<b>
We know that all of you who were planning to give papers, or participate in other ways, will be as disappointed as we are. However, we hope you’ll understand; once the current problems have diminished we’ll be back in touch about setting another date to run a full workshop.

<b>
Your registration fees will be refunded, however we would appreciate your patience as we work through the administration of this.

<b>
We are all tremendously disappointed, and thank you for your understanding.

## ~~Call for Presentations~~

**Submissions are now closed -- see the list of [accepted talks](#accepted-talks) below.**

We invite you to submit 500 word / 0.5 page abstracts (PDF or plain text) of
work for presentation at the next UK Systems Research Challenges workshop. In
most cases the main points to include in the abstract are the problem being
solved, the new idea or hypothesis being explored in your work, and the current
state of the project (e.g., whether you are looking for feedback on an early
idea or presenting finished results that others might want to use).

We're interested in presentations that speak to:

  * innovative mechanisms
  * lessons learned: experience with large or unusual systems
  * a viewpoint on a controversial systems topic
  * a big problem coming over the horizon

and really, anything that would be of interest to the builders of computer
systems.

This is an informal workshop without published proceedings. Work is not subject
to detailed peer review; we are requesting abstracts only to help us put
together the programme and confirm that work is on-topic. In the event of an
excess of submissions, preference for presentation slots will be given to Ph.D.
students and early career researchers.
