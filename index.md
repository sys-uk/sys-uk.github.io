# Fourth Annual UK System Research Challenges Workshop, March 27--29, 2019

## Location & Transport
The workshop will be held at the [Redworth Hall][venue], Northumberland. We are providing coach transport between the venue and Newcastle city centre ([Urban Sciences Building, 1 Science Square, Science Central, NE4 5TG][ncl]) as follows:
  - **March 27, 17:00**: A coach will depart the [Urban Sciences Building][ncl]
    to [Linden Hall][venue].
  - **March 29, 14:00**: A coach will depart [Redworth Hall][venue] to the [Urban
    Sciences Building][ncl]. Expected arrival is 15:00.

Note that this is not a shuttle service but a single coach in each direction.
For those travelling on from Newcastle after the workshop by train, we would
suggest booking a train after 15:30 to allow for delays.
